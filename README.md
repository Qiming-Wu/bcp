# Lipschitz-Certifiable Training with a Tight Outer Bound

This repository is the official implementation of Lipschitz-Certifiable Training with a Tight Outer Bound.

<!----
> ðŸ“‹Optional: include a graphic explaining your approach/main result, bibtex entry, link to demos, blog posts and tutorials
---->

## Requirements

To install requirements:

```setup
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

<!----
> ðŸ“‹Describe how to set up the environment, e.g. pip/conda/docker commands, download datasets, etc...
---->

## Training (and Evaluation)

To train and evaluate the model(s) in the paper, run this command:

```train
python main_mnist.py
python main_cifar10.py
```

<!----
> ðŸ“‹Describe how to train the models, with example commands on how to train the models in your paper, including the full training procedure and appropriate hyperparameters.
---->

## Evaluation of pretrained models

To evaluate the pretrained model, run:

```eval
python eval.py --model-file mymodel.pth --benchmark imagenet
```

<!----
> ðŸ“‹Describe how to evaluate the trained models on benchmarks reported in the paper, give commands that produce the results (section below).
---->

## Pre-trained Models

You can download pretrained models here:

- [My awesome model](https://drive.google.com/mymodel.pth) trained on ImageNet using parameters x,y,z. 

<!----
> ðŸ“‹Give a link to where/how the pretrained models can be downloaded and how they were trained (if applicable).  Alternatively you can have an additional column in your results table with a link to the models.
